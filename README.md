# Ender-5-SKR2-BLT_Klipper

I decided this was a good idea to do, after accidentally ruining the cd card from my raspberry pi.
I am rebuilding my config, basically from scratch, with a few tidbits from an old backup from before
I really knew what I was doing, but had a few things added through other people's Gits.
